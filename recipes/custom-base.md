# Recipe Base Images

Custom base images are only support for our Enterprise customers. If you need a custom base image, please reach out to your support contact at DevZero.\
\
DevZero currently uses `ubuntu:22.04` as the base OS for all recipe builds. We anticipate releasing custom base images to all users sometime later this year.
