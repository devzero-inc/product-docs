## What is a Recipe

[Recipe specifications](../references/terminology.md#recipe) are YAML-based definitions that outline the resources, infrastructure, and configuration of a DevZero [workspace](../references/terminology.md#workspace). These specifications are centrally stored and version-controlled by DevZero, ensuring your team always has access to the most up-to-date and consistent environments.

Key features of recipe specifications:

1. **Shared via Recipe Library:** Team members can access and use recipes through a centralized Recipe Library ([My Recipes](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/recipes#user)).
2. **Consistent Environments:** Ensures all team members use identical, up-to-date development and testing environments.
3. **Golden Path Definition:** Typically defines the optimal setup for developing and testing specific applications or microservices.
4. **Version Control:** Allows tracking of changes and rollbacks if needed.
5. **Resource Management:** Specifies all necessary resources and infrastructure for a workspace.

By utilizing recipe specifications, teams can streamline their development process, reduce environment-related issues, and maintain consistency across different projects and team members.
