The DevZero Network uses a decentralized VPN strategy to enable secure access to [nodes](../references/terminology.md#node) across your team. We accomplish thiusing WireGuard.

Within the DevZero network, nodes either connect peer-to-peer (using [NAT Traversal](../references/terminology.md#nat-traversal)), or through a [relay](../references/terminology.md#relay).
