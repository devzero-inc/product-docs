You are connecting to an App Service running on your Azure infrastructure from your DevBox.

## Architecture Diagram

![Azure App Service Architecture](../../../.gitbook/assets/azure-app-service-architecture.png)

[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service) enables you to build and host web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. This connection between the app service and workspace would occur by setting up a bastion host that advertises the private routes to your DevZero network so you can access the private service through network tunneling. You must also set up a DNS Private Resolver to access the App Service's Private Endpoint from your DevBox.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you begin, follow the [Connecting to Azure](../../existing-network/connecting-to-azure.md) guide to set up the Bastion Host to access your private Azure services.
2. Following the above criteria, follow the [Setting up DNS Private Resolver](./setting-up-dns-private-resolver.md) guide to access the DNS Private Zones.

## Existing Azure App Services

To connect to an App Service running in the private subnet, please ensure it is within the same **Resource Group** and **VNET** containing the Bastion Host.

### Step 1: Creating a Workspace from the Recipe

It would be best if you created a workspace so you can access the app service:

1. Go to [DevZero Dashboard](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard).
2. Navigate to the **Workspaces** tab and click on **New workspace**.
3. Enter the workspace name and click on **Select from recipe library**.
4. Click on **New Recipe** and enter the recipe name and click on **Create a recipe**.
5. Select a workspace region and click on **Launch**.

### Step 2: Creating a Private Endpoint

1. Navigate to **Networking** and open **Private Endpoints** page.
2. Click on **Add > Express** and then enter the name of your private endpoint.
3. Then select the VNET and a compatible subnet. Turn on the **Integrate with private DNS zone** option.
4. Click on **Ok**, and your private connection to your web app will be successfully deployed.

### Step 3: Accessing App Service from DevBox

Follow the Below steps to access your Web App from your DevBox :

1. Connect to the workspace using the following command:

```
sudo dz workspace connect <workspace-name>
```

2. Copy the **Default domain** of the **App Service** you want to access.
3. Connect to the **App Service**:

```
curl -X GET <default-domain>
```
