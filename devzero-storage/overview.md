# DevZero Storage

## Volume

Volume is a storage device. It may be used only by one workspace, or can be attached to multiple, in a read-write capacity. It usually shows up on a workspace as a filesystem.

## Ceph

Ceph is a free and open-source software-defined storage platform that provides object storage, block storage, and file storage built on a common distributed cluster foundation.

## Mount

The methodology that's used to enable a workspace to have access to persistent volumes (can be verified by running mount in a UNIX shell).

## Persistent Volumes

Persistent volumes are network-backed block devices that are mounted to workspaces. This ensures that changes made inside a workspace are resilient to restarts, etc.
