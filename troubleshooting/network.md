<summary>Unable to connect to DevZero network when using Tailscale</summary>

If your machine is already connected to another Tailscale network, you might be unable to connect to the DevZero network.\
\
The immediate fix for this is to turn off Tailscale and use SSH to connect to your workspace instead (using the hostname).\
\
If you need both networks to co-exist, you can reach out to [support@devzero.io](mailto:support@devzero.io)
