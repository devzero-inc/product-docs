title: Updating the CLI
---
A single CLI (called `dz`) is used to interact with DevZero control plane. Check out the [CLI main page](../../references/cli-man-page/) for DevZero CLI options or use.

To check the currently installed version of your CLI, run:

```python
dz version
```

To update your CLI, run (might require `sudo`!):

```python
dz update
```

To see the manpage for the CLI (with all the commands), run
```
dz -h
```

```
For help on subcommands, add --help after: "dz workspace --help".
	This CLI is still under active development. Commands and flags will
	change in the future.
