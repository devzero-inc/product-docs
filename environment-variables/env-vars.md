# Overview

Environment variables are materially public in nature. If you want to store or reference a secret value, see [Secrets](secrets.md).

These are usually used by when:

* a build is getting created,
* a process needs it at launch or runtime

Once an environment variable is saved, it will be visible in the UI or CLI. It will be available at build- or launch-time. It will also be available in the running workspaces.

> **Reserved prefix** `DEVZERO_` is a reserved prefix used by the platform. They may change at any time so relying on them is not advisable.
> You may store environment variables or secrets with line breaks.

You can access environment variables within builds or at launch-time. If your variable is called `MY_KEY`, to access its value anywhere, use `$MY_KEY`. At runtime, you can use the `env` binary to verify that the secrets are present within that context.

To access environment variables within the workspace, you can define them in the runtime section like this:

```yaml
runtime:
  environment:
    - name: TEST_TEAM_ENV
      value: "{{secret:team.TEST_TEAM_ENV}}"
    - name: TEST_USER_ENV
      value: "{{secret:user.TEST_USER_ENV}}"
    - name: FOO
      value: "bar"
```
