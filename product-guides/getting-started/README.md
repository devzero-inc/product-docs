We currently only support GitHub as a code provider for DevZero workspaces. Bitbucket and GitLab support are coming soon!\
\
If you only plan to work with Public Repositories, you do not need to enable our GitHub integration. However, if you'd like to work with private repositories from within a DevZero workspace you'll need to head to [https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/settings/user-settings](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/settings/user-settings) and complete the installation steps.

<summary><strong>Step 3:</strong> Install the DevZero CLI</summary>

DevZero CLI is required if you want to connect a local IDE to a remote environment.

<summary><strong>Step 4:</strong> Write your first Recipe</summary>

Recipes are a blueprint of your environment. Importing your repository and creating a recipe is required only once.

<summary><strong>Step 5:</strong> Launch &#x26; connect to your first Workspace</summary>

Once a recipe is created, anyone who has access to that recipe can launch a workspace.

<summary><strong>Setup 6:</strong> Invite your team</summary>

DevZero is a productivity booster when shared with others. Once a recipe is created and placed in a shared library, onboarding new members and getting them to ready-to-code state takes minutes.
